# Computer-iteracy-quiz
A fun quiz for my NCEA Level 3 English Seminar, where I discussed the issues surrounding the current computer literacy gap. I made this to involve and engage my classmates in my seminar and give them an idea about the things involved in being computer literate.

# Decription
A completely front-end program which features 7 questions in multiple choice question format, and shows the user the number of correct questions they got after finishing the quiz.
